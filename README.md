## Changes Made

Based on feedback, the application has been migrated from a console-based interface to a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) interface for enhanced usability. Additional features such as filtering recipes by ingredient, food group, and calories were implemented. Recipe scaling options were added to adjust ingredient quantities by 0.5, 2, or 3 times. A calorie warning feature was also introduced to alert users if the scaled recipe exceeds 300 calories. These changes were made to improve functionality and user experience, making the application more robust and user-friendly.
